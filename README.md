- PgAdmin
- Python 3 
- Vs code

## Overview of the Analysis


The purpose of this project, is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. In the second, we added employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.

## The Results
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. These current retire-eligible employees can be found here:

There is another result, identifies employee who are eligible for the mentorship program can be viewed here: [Mentorship_Eligibility](https://github.com/JohnCselcuk/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv)

All of these current retire-eligible employees have held different positions at Pewlett Hackard. According to the table below, nearly 14,000 and roughly 13,000 had senior engineer and engineer positions, respectively. Following this group, almost 13,000 and 12,000 had senior staff and staff positions, respectively. It was interesting to see that there were only a handful of manager positions. This could be a good opportunity for HR to investigate why there were so few managers
