We used several tools to complete this Analysis:
- QuickDBD
- PgAdmin
- Python 3 
- Vs code

## Overview of the Analysis


The purpose of this project, is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. In the second, we added employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.

## The Results
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. A quick query helped inform HR that they have 33,118 current employees who are eligible for retirement. These current retire-eligible employees can be found here:
