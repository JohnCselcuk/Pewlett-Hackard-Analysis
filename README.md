# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis


The purpose of this project, is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. In the second, we added employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.
